      Cerena™ is available to patients today, but only by prescription from your doctor. Due to COVID-19, the FDA recognizes that cancer patients are struggling now more than ever. Their recent guidance enables the immediate release of cerena™, while it is also being studied in clinical trials. If you’re still receiving medical treatment for your cancer, you can use cerena™ at the same time.
